Python - More Classes and Objects
Python Classes
A class is considered as a blueprint of objects.

Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.

Syntax: Class Definition

class ClassName: # Statement

Python Objects
An object is called an instance of a class. An object consists of :

State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
Behaviour: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
